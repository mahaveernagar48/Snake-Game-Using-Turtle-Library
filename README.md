# Snake-Game-Using-Turtle-Library

In this project I build a snake game using a turtle library from scratch.

I used different modules and classes from turtle library to build this game.

Below are some of the modules and packages.
<ul>
    <li> <b>init</b>: Initialization method of the centroids. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> Value will be: "k-means++" </li>
        <li> k-means++: Selects initial cluster centers for k-mean clustering in a smart way to speed up convergence.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> <b>n_clusters</b>: The number of clusters to form as well as the number of centroids to generate. </li>
    <ul> <li> Value will be: 3 (since we have 3 centers)</li> </ul>
    <li> <b>n_init</b>: Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of n_init consecutive runs in terms of inertia. </li>
    <ul> <li> Value will be: 12 </li> </ul>
</ul>
