# Snake-Game-Using-Turtle-Library

In this project I build a snake game using a turtle library from scratch.

Different classes, modules and packages have been used while creating this game.

There are mainly four steps included in this project.

1. snake.py : In this py file I have created a snake body and I have implemented all the functionality which needs to be there while developing the snake game.
2. food.py : In this py file I created the snake's food. Once the snake's body touches the food body snake will automatically increase its size.
3. scoreboard.py : In this file, I have added scorecard functionality. As soon as the snake touches the food, the scorecard will increase by one automatically.
4. main.py : This is the main file that imports all the functionality from other files and makes the snake game functional according to the needs.
